As the name implies, this helps to determine that a user is an actual person and not a computer posing as a human. In contrast to the standard Turing test, CAPTCHA is administered by a machine and targeted to a human as opposed to being administered by a human and targeted to a machine. A computer asks a user to complete a simple test then generates a grade for that test. Computers are unable to solve the problem, so correct solutions are deemed to be the result of a person taking the test. A common type of CAPTCHA is the test that requires the typing of distorted letters, numbers or symbols that appear in an image undecipherable by a computer.<sup id=""cite_ref-FOOTNOTEO&#39;BrienMarakas2011_286-0"" class=""reference""><a href=""#cite_note-FOOTNOTEO&#39;BrienMarakas2011-286"">&#91;275&#93; </a> </sup>",0

"<p>In his book <i><a href=""/wiki/Superintelligence:_Paths,_Dangers,_Strategies"" title=""Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies"">Superintelligence </a> </i>, philosopher <a href=""/wiki/Nick_Bostrom"" title=""Nick Bostrom"">Nick Bostrom </a> provides an argument that artificial intelligence will pose a threat to humankind. He argues that sufficiently intelligent AI, if it chooses actions based on achieving some goal, will exhibit <a href=""/wiki/Instrumental_convergence"" title=""Instrumental convergence"">convergent </a> behavior such as acquiring resources or protecting itself from being shut down. If this AI's goals do not fully reflect humanity's—one example is an AI told to compute as many digits of pi as possible—it might harm humanity in order to acquire more resources or prevent itself from being shut down, ultimately to better achieve its goal.  Bostrom also emphasizes the difficulty of fully conveying humanity's values to an advanced AI.  He uses the hypothetical example of giving an AI the goal to make humans smile to illustrate a misguided attempt.  If the AI in that scenario were to become superintelligent, Bostrom argues, it may resort to methods that most humans would find horrifying, such as inserting ""electrodes into the facial muscles of humans to cause constant, beaming grins"" because that would be an efficient way to achieve its goal of making humans smile.<sup id=""cite_ref-368"" class=""reference""><a href=""#cite_note-368"">&#91;357&#93; </a> </sup>  In his book <i><a href=""/wiki/Human_Compatible"" title=""Human Compatible"">Human Compatible </a> </i>, AI researcher <a href=""/wiki/Stuart_J._Russell"" title=""Stuart J.

Model-based classifiers perform well if the assumed model is an extremely good fit for the actual data. Otherwise, if no matching model is available, and if accuracy (rather than speed or scalability) is the sole concern, conventional wisdom is that discriminative classifiers (especially SVM) tend to be more accurate than model-based classifiers such as ""naive Bayes"" on most practical data sets.<sup id=""cite_ref-Classifier_performance_230-0"" class=""reference""><a href=""#cite_note-Classifier_performance-230"">&#91;221&#93; </a> </sup><sup id=""cite_ref-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig200918.12:_Learning_from_Examples:_Summary_231-0"" class=""reference""><a href=""#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig200918.12:_Learning_from_Examples:_Summary-231"">&#91;222&#93; </a> </sup>",0

The easy problem only requires understanding the machinery in the brain that makes it possible for a person to know that the color swatch is red.

Hyper-intelligent software may not necessarily decide to support the continued existence of humanity and would be extremely difficult to stop.

"<p>The field of machine ethics is concerned with giving machines ethical principles, or a procedure for discovering a way to resolve the ethical dilemmas they might encounter, enabling them to function in an ethically responsible manner through their own ethical decision making.<sup id=""cite_ref-autogenerated1_397-0"" class=""reference""><a href=""#cite_note-autogenerated1-397"">&#91;386&#93; </a> </sup> The field was delineated in the AAAI Fall 2005 Symposium on Machine Ethics: ""Past research concerning the relationship between technology and ethics has largely focused on responsible and irresponsible use of technology by human beings, with a few people being interested in how human beings ought to treat machines. In all cases, only human beings have engaged in ethical reasoning. The time has come for adding an ethical dimension to at least some machines. Recognition of the ethical ramifications of behavior involving machines, as well as recent and potential developments in machine autonomy, necessitate this. In contrast to computer hacking, software property issues, privacy issues and other topics normally ascribed to computer ethics, machine ethics is concerned with the behavior of machines towards human users and other machines. Research in machine ethics is key to alleviating concerns with autonomous systems—it could be argued that the notion of autonomous machines without such a dimension is at the root of all fear concerning machine intelligence. Further, investigation of machine ethics could enable the discovery of problems with current ethical theories, advancing our thinking about Ethics.""<sup id=""cite_ref-autogenerated2_398-0"" class=""reference""><a href=""#cite_note-autogenerated2-398"">&#91;387&#93; </a> </sup> Machine ethics is sometimes referred to as machine morality, computational ethics or computational morality.

"<p>Neural networks were inspired by the architecture of neurons in the human brain. A simple ""neuron"" <i>N </i> accepts input from other neurons, each of which, when activated (or ""fired""), cast a weighted ""vote"" for or against whether neuron <i>N </i> should itself activate. Learning requires an algorithm to adjust these weights based on the training data; one simple algorithm (dubbed ""<a href=""/wiki/Hebbian_learning"" class=""mw-redirect"" title=""Hebbian learning"">fire together, wire together </a>"") is to increase the weight between two connected neurons when the activation of one triggers the successful activation of another. The neural network forms ""concepts"" that are distributed among a subnetwork of shared<sup id=""cite_ref-232"" class=""reference""><a href=""#cite_note-232"">&#91;j&#93; </a> </sup> neurons that tend to fire together; a concept meaning ""leg"" might be coupled with a subnetwork meaning ""foot"" that includes the sound for ""foot"". Neurons have a continuous spectrum of activation; in addition, neurons can process inputs in a nonlinear way rather than weighing straightforward votes. Modern neural networks can learn both continuous functions and, surprisingly, digital logical operations. Neural networks' early successes included predicting the stock market and (in 1995) a mostly self-driving car.<sup id=""cite_ref-233"" class=""reference""><a href=""#cite_note-233"">&#91;k&#93; </a> </sup><sup id=""cite_ref-FOOTNOTEDomingos2015Chapter_4_234-0"" class=""reference""><a href=""#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDomingos2015Chapter_4-234"">&#91;223&#93; </a> </sup> In the 2010s, advances in neural networks using deep learning thrust AI into widespread public consciousness and contributed to an enormous upshift in corporate AI spending; for example, AI-related <a href=""/wiki/Mergers_and_acquisitions"" title=""Mergers and acquisitions"">M&amp;A </a> in 2017 was over 25 times as large as in 2015.<sup id=""cite_ref-235"" class=""reference""><a href=""#cite_note-235"">&#91;224&#93; </a> </sup><sup id=""cite_ref-236"" class=""reference""><a href=""#cite_note-236"">&#91;225&#93; </a> </sup>",0

"<dd>An <a href=""/wiki/Intelligent_agent"" title=""Intelligent agent"">intelligent agent </a> is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions which maximize its chances of success. The simplest intelligent agents are programs that solve specific problems. More complicated agents include human beings and organizations of human beings (such as <a href=""/wiki/Firm"" class=""mw-redirect"" title=""Firm"">firms </a>). The paradigm allows researchers to directly compare or even combine different approaches to isolated problems, by asking which agent is best at maximizing a given ""goal function"". An agent that solves a specific problem can use any approach that works—some agents are symbolic and logical, some are sub-symbolic <a href=""/wiki/Artificial_neural_network"" title=""Artificial neural network"">artificial neural networks </a> and others may use new approaches. The paradigm also gives researchers a common language to communicate with other fields—such as <a href=""/wiki/Decision_theory"" title=""Decision theory"">decision theory </a> and economics—that also use concepts of abstract agents. Building a complete agent requires researchers to address realistic problems of integration; for example, because sensory systems give uncertain information about the environment, planning systems must be able to function in the presence of uncertainty. The intelligent agent paradigm became widely accepted during the 1990s.<sup id=""cite_ref-Intelligent_agents_179-0"" class=""reference""><a href=""#cite_note-Intelligent_agents-179"">&#91;175&#93; </a> </sup> </dd> </dl>",0

""Today's AI technologies are powerful but unreliable.  Rules-based systems cannot deal with circumstances their programmers did not anticipate.  Learning systems are limited by the data on which they were trained.  AI failures have already led to tragedy.  Advanced autopilot features in cars, although they perform well in some circumstances, have driven cars without warning into trucks, concrete barriers, and parked cars.  In the wrong situation, AI systems go from supersmart to superdumb in an instant.  When an enemy is trying to manipulate and hack an AI system, the risks are even greater.""  (p.&#160;140.) </li>",0

""Lexical affinity"" strategies use the occurrence of words such as ""accident"" to <a href=""/wiki/Sentiment_analysis"" title=""Sentiment analysis"">assess the sentiment </a> of a document.

This map would include data on the approximations of street light and curb heights in order for the vehicle to be aware of its surroundings. However, Google has been working on an algorithm with the purpose of eliminating the need for pre-programmed maps and instead, creating a device that would be able to adjust to a variety of new surroundings.<sup id=""cite_ref-311"" class=""reference""><a href=""#cite_note-311"">&#91;300&#93; </a> </sup> Some self-driving cars are not equipped with steering wheels or brake pedals, so there has also been research focused on creating an algorithm that is capable of maintaining a safe environment for the passengers in the vehicle through awareness of speed and driving conditions.<sup id=""cite_ref-312"" class=""reference""><a href=""#cite_note-312"">&#91;301&#93; </a> </sup>",0

"<p>The <a href=""/wiki/Cybersecurity"" class=""mw-redirect"" title=""Cybersecurity"">cybersecurity </a> arena faces significant challenges in the form of larges scale hacking attacks of different types which harm organizations of all kinds and create billions of dollars in business damage. Artificial intelligence and Natural Language Processing (NLP) has begun to be used by security companies - for example SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) solutions.  The more advanced of these solutions use AI and NLP to automatically sort the data in networks into high risk and low risk information.  This enables security teams to focus on the attacks that have the potential to do real harm to the organization, and not become victims of attacks such as <a href=""/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack"" title=""Denial-of-service attack"">Denial of Service (DoS) </a>, <a href=""/wiki/Malware"" title=""Malware"">Malware </a> and others.",0
