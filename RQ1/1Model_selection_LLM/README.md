# How to Replicate experimental results.

Our experimental results are stored in the "result" directory within each folder. Running the "result_analysis.py" script will yield the results shown in Table 2.

# How to re-Train and Test
If you need to fine-tune the LLaMA base model, you can modify the path to your model base accordingly. Then, run "Train.py" and "Test.py" to obtain the result logs. After that, adjust the path and run "result_analysis.py" to get the final results.
